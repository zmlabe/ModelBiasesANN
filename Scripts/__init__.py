The Python repository "ExtremeEvents" contains the scripts, data,
figures, and text for investigating global climate model biases using large ensembles and neural networks. In particular, we focus on how unforced internal variability compares during the historical period. We are interested in using explainable AI for better understanding these nonlinear
relationships.
