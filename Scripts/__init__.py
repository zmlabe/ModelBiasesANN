The Python repository "ModelBiasesANN" contains the scripts, data,
figures, and text for investigating global climate model biases using large ensembles and neural networks. In particular, we evaluate whether neural networks can be used to identify climate models in the form of a classification problem. We then use layer-wise relevance propagation to identify how the neural makes its correct classification, especially after testing data from observations.
